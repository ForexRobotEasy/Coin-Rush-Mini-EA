# Coin Rush Mini EA

Coin Rush Mini EA is a streamlined forex trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA incorporates five different trading strategies to maximize profit potential. The strategies implemented are as follows:

## Strategy 1: Trend Following
This strategy aims to identify and follow the prevailing market trend. It utilizes technical indicators to determine the direction of the market and enter trades in the same direction as the trend.

## Strategy 2: Range Trading
The range trading strategy is used when the market is trading within a specific range. It identifies support and resistance levels and executes trades when the price bounces off these levels.

## Strategy 3: Breakout Trading
Breakout trading involves identifying key levels of support and resistance and entering trades when the price breaks out of these levels. This strategy aims to capture significant price movements after a period of consolidation.

## Strategy 4: Reversal Trading
The reversal trading strategy aims to identify potential trend reversals. It looks for overbought or oversold conditions and executes trades when there is a high probability of a trend reversal.

## Strategy 5: Scalping
Scalping is a short-term trading strategy that aims to profit from small price movements. It involves entering and exiting trades quickly to take advantage of market volatility.

The main function of the EA is the `OnTick()` function, which calls each trading strategy function in order to execute the trading strategies. The `OnTick()` function is triggered on each tick of the market, ensuring that the EA is constantly evaluating and executing trades based on the selected strategies.

To optimize performance, the EA includes a `optimizePerformance()` function that focuses on trade execution speed, minimizing latency, and optimizing resource usage. This helps to ensure that the EA operates efficiently and effectively.

Quality assurance testing is performed using the `monteCarloTesting()` function. This testing methodology verifies the performance and reliability of the Coin Rush Mini EA, providing confidence in its trading capabilities.
